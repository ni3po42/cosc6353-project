# cosc6353-project
Source code for the cosc6353 Software design course
This repository is to bridge the gap of the SVN repository; continue to use the SVN to commit documents, diagrams and responses to questions. This Git repo will be only for the source code of the web application and associated tests.

This readme will eventually contain information for setting up the environments for hosting (localhost or server) the application. 
Stay tuned!
